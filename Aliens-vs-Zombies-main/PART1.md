## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.

1. For the player movement controls when we tried to set up the input to "up","down","left" or "right" we encountered errors as those inputs are recognised as multicharacter datatypes. Changing the data types also resulted in an error. We figured out an easy solution by substituting inputs of up,down,left and right to single literal characters ('w','a','s','d') and initialise the input for direction with the data type char. 

2. There were errors and bugs when we tried to implement game board dimension customisation feature in the settings. So for now the game board size will be set to a constant size (15) as a temporary fix.
